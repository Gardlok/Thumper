Concurrent tasks health monitoring

Sometimes I've wanted to know if some asynchronous task is _ticking_ as it should be. This is an attempt to implement health status monitoring. This is currently very alpha/experimental and should not be used in a critical production environment yet. 

TODO:
- Add example
- Implement allowing of user to configure the "CAP" defaults
